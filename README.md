# Streams

## Arcutucture Used

### Initial Setup using create-react-app

### API built using json-server

[x] Setup CRUD operations between the API and Client App

> A little about this project.  The React Streaming project starts out with create-react-app then I created the CRUD functions the Actions/index. Also created GoogleAuth meathod that allows users to login with their userId.  Created the Reducers for both the authReducer and streamsReducer.  The history file is there to retain previous history events and recall within the application.
